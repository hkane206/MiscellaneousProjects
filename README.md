# MiscellaneousProjects
Projects that I completed from Data Structures and Algorithms class in Fall 2022 (most are improving the efficiency of projects presented to us already using concepts presented in class. 


# Markov
In this project, I improved the efficiency of a Markov Generating Model by implementing hashing.

# DNA
In this project, I improved the efficiency of a script meant to mimic the behavior of a restriction enzyme using Linked Lists. 

# Autocomplete
In this project, I implemented a more efficient Autocomplete interface by using Binary Search, Comparators, and hashing.

# Huffman
In this project, I used the Huffman algorithm to compress and decompress text files.

# Route
In this project, I used Djikstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two different cities in a network of cities in the USA given lattitude and longitude coordinates.
